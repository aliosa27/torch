Description:  msmtp is an SMTP client. In the default mode, it transmits a mail to
 an SMTP server (for example at a free mail provider) which does the
 delivery. To use this program with your mail user agent (MUA), create
 a configuration file with your mail account(s) and tell your MUA to
 call msmtp instead of /usr/sbin/sendmail.
 This package is built with SSL support.
